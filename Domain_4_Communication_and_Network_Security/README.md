CISSP Domain 2: Communications and network security

Subdomain 1: Assess and implement secure design principles in network architectures
Open system interconnection (OSI) and transmission control protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP) models
Internet protocol (IP) networking (e.g., internet protocol security (IPSec), internet protocol (IP) v4/6)
Secure protocols
Implications of multilayer protocols
Converged protocols (e.g., fiber channel over ethernet (FCoE), internet small computer systems interface (iSCSI), voice over internet protocol (VoIP))
Micro-segmentation (e.g., software defined networks (SDN), virtual eXtensible local area network (VXLAN), encapsulation, software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN))
Wireless networks (e.g., Li-Fi, Wi-Fi, Zigbee, satellite)
Cellular networks (e.g., 4G, 5G)
Content distribution networks (CDN)
